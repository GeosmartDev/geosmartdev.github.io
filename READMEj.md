Iâ€™m passionate about building the future of GeoAI. With over a decade of experience designing and implementing geospatial solutions, Iâ€™m focused on creating technologies that solve real-world challenges, especially across Africa. My work combines geospatial intelligence, AI, and data-driven systems to make location insights more accessible, actionable, and impactful. I believe Africaâ€™s growth is deeply tied to how we use location data to drive smarter decisions. Here, I'll share projects, ideas, and experiments at the intersection of maps, data, and innovation. Always learning, always building â€” and always excited to collaborate
